1.What is a Node module?

  A collection of functions to include in your application. You can think of a module
  as a Javascript library.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

  exports is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign the object module.exports.
  module.exports is the variable that gets returned for the keyword require() when importing
  node modules.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

  exports is recommended if you don't need your module to be a specific object type.
  exports is a convenience variable to help module authors write less code.
